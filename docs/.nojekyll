# Its presence disables Jekyll processing on GitHub Pages.
# This is useful for deploying static sites that don't require Jekyll.
#
# Without this file, GitHub Pages will attempt to build the site using Jekyll,
# which can lead to unexpected behavior or build failures if the site
# doesn't conform to Jekyll's requirements.
#
# For HTML-based repositories, disabling Jekyll is often the simplest
# and most reliable way to deploy static content.
